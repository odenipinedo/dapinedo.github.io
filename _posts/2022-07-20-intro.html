Hello, and thank you for visiting.<br> 
Please browse the menu items to view samples of my work.<br>
<br>
My hobbies include cooking fancy Mexican food, playing guitar and trombone, and painting.<br>
<br>
I like to keep fit through weight training, 5k running (OK, more like walking TBH), rowing, and meditating.<br>
<br>
You may contact me through the Linkedin or Contact links provided in the menu.
